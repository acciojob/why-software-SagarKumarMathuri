	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>I want to become a software developer because I am passionate about building things that solve real-world problems. 
        Technology has always fascinated me, and I love how code can turn ideas into functioning tools and applications. 
        Being a developer gives me the ability to create, innovate, and continuously learn in a fast-evolving field. 
        I am motivated by the challenge of solving complex problems and the satisfaction of seeing my work make a difference 
        in peopleâ€™s lives.</p>
